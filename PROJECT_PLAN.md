### Unleash In-App Debugging for WKWebView Without Safari Web Inspector

While Safari Web Inspector is a powerful tool for debugging `WKWebView`, you can build a robust suite of in-app debugging capabilities directly within your iOS project, offering greater flexibility and control. This allows for a customized debugging experience tailored to your application's specific needs, without complete reliance on Safari's developer tools. Here are several testability ideas you can implement using the `WKWebView` API.

#### 1. JavaScript Execution and Logging

A fundamental technique for debugging is to execute JavaScript within the `WKWebView` and log the results to your Xcode console or an in-app console.

**Executing JavaScript:** The `evaluateJavaScript(_:completionHandler:)` method is your primary tool for interacting with the web content. You can execute any JavaScript code and receive the result asynchronously.

**Capturing Console Logs:** To capture JavaScript's `console.log` messages, you can override the default implementation and forward the messages to your native code using `WKScriptMessageHandler`.

Here's a conceptual implementation:

First, inject a script at the beginning of the document that overrides `console.log`:

```swift
// Swift
let scriptSource = """
    function captureLog(message) {
        window.webkit.messageHandlers.logHandler.postMessage(message);
    }
    window.console.log = captureLog;
"""
let script = WKUserScript(source: scriptSource, injectionTime: .atDocumentStart, forMainFrameOnly: true)
let contentController = WKUserContentController()
contentController.addUserScript(script)
contentController.add(self, name: "logHandler")

let configuration = WKWebViewConfiguration()
configuration.userContentController = contentController

let webView = WKWebView(frame: .zero, configuration: configuration)
```

Then, conform to `WKScriptMessageHandler` to receive the messages:

```swift
// Swift
extension YourViewController: WKScriptMessageHandler {
    func userContentController(_ userContentController: WKUserContentController, didReceive message: WKScriptMessage) {
        if message.name == "logHandler" {
            print("JavaScript log: \(message.body)")
        }
    }
}
```

This approach allows you to see all `console.log` output from your web content directly within your native debugging environment.

#### 2. DOM Inspection and Manipulation

Although you can't directly access the DOM from your Swift or Objective-C code due to `WKWebView` running in a separate process, you can still inspect and manipulate it programmatically.

By using `evaluateJavaScript`, you can execute scripts that query the DOM and return the results as a string, often in JSON format. For example, you could retrieve the outer HTML of a specific element:

```swift
// Swift
webView.evaluateJavaScript("document.getElementById('myElement').outerHTML") { (result, error) in
    if let html = result as? String {
        print("Element HTML: \(html)")
    }
}
```

You can also create more complex JavaScript functions to traverse the DOM, gather specific attributes, and then return a structured JSON string to be parsed on the native side. This allows you to build your own DOM inspector within your app.

#### 3. Network Request Interception and Inspection

For monitoring network traffic, `WKURLSchemeHandler` provides a powerful mechanism to intercept and handle custom URL schemes. This allows you to inspect requests and even provide your own responses, which is useful for testing offline behavior or mocking API calls.

To implement this:
1.  Register a custom URL scheme with your `WKWebViewConfiguration`.
2.  Create a class that conforms to `WKURLSchemeHandler`.
3.  Implement the required methods to handle the start and stop of URL scheme tasks.

Here is a simplified example:

```swift
// Swift
// 1. In your configuration
let configuration = WKWebViewConfiguration()
configuration.setURLSchemeHandler(MyURLSchemeHandler(), forURLScheme: "my-custom-scheme")
let webView = WKWebView(frame: .zero, configuration: configuration)

// 2. Load a request with the custom scheme
if let url = URL(string: "my-custom-scheme://example.com/data") {
    webView.load(URLRequest(url: url))
}

// 3. The handler class
class MyURLSchemeHandler: NSObject, WKURLSchemeHandler {
    func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, start urlSchemeTask: WKURLSchemeTask) {
        print("Intercepted request to: \(urlSchemeTask.request.url?.absoluteString ?? "")")
        // Here you can inspect the request and provide a custom response
        // For example, load data from a local file or a mocked network response
    }

    func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, stop urlSchemeTask: WKURLSchemeTask) {
        // Cleanup
    }
}
```

For intercepting standard `http` and `https` requests, the process is more involved and may require third-party libraries that use method swizzling on `NSURLProtocol`, though this approach should be used with caution.

#### 4. Programmatic Inspection Control

While the goal is to avoid relying on Safari Web Inspector, it can still be a useful tool. With recent versions of iOS, you must explicitly enable inspectability for your `WKWebView`. You can control this with the `isInspectable` property, which can be toggled at runtime.

```swift
// Swift
webView.isInspectable = true
```

This is particularly useful for debug builds of your application, where you might want to enable the inspector for deeper investigation when needed. For apps linked against SDKs before iOS 16.4 and macOS 13.3, `WKWebView` instances were inspectable by default in debug builds.

#### 5. User-Friendly Debug Overlays

You can combine these techniques to create a user-friendly debug overlay within your app. This overlay could display:
*   A console view that shows captured JavaScript logs.
*   A network history view that lists intercepted requests.
*   A DOM inspector that allows you to view the structure of the current page.

By building these tools directly into your application, you provide a powerful and context-aware debugging experience that is always available during development and testing, without the need to connect to a Mac and launch Safari's Web Inspector.
